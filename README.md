### Quote
> “Tech will test your patience, your confidence, and your stamina. There will be nights when nothing makes sense, when the code breaks, the logic feels impossible, and you wonder if you belong. If it feels overwhelming, you are not alone. Tech is not about being perfect; it is about being persistent. You just need to keep coming back to the keyboard. You do not have to know everything to belong here. Give yourself permission to grow at your own pace. Every small breakthrough adds up. And if you keep showing up, even on the hard days, you will be amazed at who you become. Your effort is building something real, even when you cannot see it yet. Keep going. You’ve got this.”
